0. ssa of tuple dot and select ....
0-1. before SSA, do a little pass on lnast for determining dot/sel lhs/rhs
0-2. at first SSA pass -> treat ldot/lsel as assign and update lhs cnt and token
0-3. at second SSA pass -> if ldot/lsel ->copy token.subs
                        -> elif rdot/rsel ->ssa_rhs_handle_a_statement
